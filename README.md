# Pivoting_manager

This tool is designed to automate tunnel creation using chisel-based pivoting techniques, and other types of tunnels will be added later. 

Current functionality:
1. Creating a tunnel
2. Logging 
3. Tunnel graph 
4. Export/import configuration
5. You can run a command through proxychains to verify 
6. When creating a tunnel, a file is automatically created.conf for proxychains

This is the first version with the basic chisel functionality (Dynamic Port Forwarding) and in the future other types of tunneling will be supported.
